#### Key Steps for the Project

Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

1. Pick a dataset, as mentioned on the previous page.

2. Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3. Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

* Prepare data:
Gather necessary data to answer your questions

Handle categorical and missing data

Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them

* Analyze, Model, and Visualize

Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them

4. Communicate your business insights:

* Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind

* Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

#### Library used

```
plotly
matplotlib
jupyter notebook
numpy
pandas
zipfile
```

#### Motivation of the project

The datasets I will pick up are the stack overflow surveys ranged for 5 years from 2018 to 2022. By doing this, I could analyze the historical data overtime and hopefully be able to predict the trend for the upcoming years for web developers which is the job I am currently doing.

#### File Structure

```
data: all the data to be analyzed are saved in this folder
data science blog.ipynb: this is the jupyter notebook I used to analyze the data
readme.md: general intro for this project
```

#### Summary of the findings

For this project I have analyzed what are the web frameworks the developers are currently working with, what frameworks the developers wish to work with in the future; Also I have tried to analyze the tools/programming languages the developers desired in their toolset.

Our analysis of the Stack Overflow survey from 2018 to 2022 provided valuable insights into the developer community's preferences and aspirations. We observed shifts in popularity, desired programming languages, and preferred tools and technologies. The web development landscape is constantly evolving, and it is essential for developers to stay informed about these trends to make informed decisions and keep their skillsets up to date.
